              <em>Hacking Monetary Systems</em>
              <p>
                Monetary systems are information systems. The most important component is the human brain and money is data - it must have physical and logical integrity. Join the inventor of the RAIDA ( Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents ) - a replacement to the Blockchain - who will discuss the rise and fall of currencies including the destruction of the cryptocurrencies and the digital currencies that will replace them.

              <em>SDR Experimenting With Breaking Into Cars</em>
              <p>
                Software Defined Radios are becoming increasingly more available and simpler to program, however much research into this field is lacking. Therefore a lot of our RF security protocols are wildly outdated. One example is that of our current Key Fob security system we have for most vehicles. I explored most of the security steps that were implemented in the last two decades, and creative ways to get around them.

              <p>
                The most compelling products solve problems and add value. The truth is products resonate with users not by the design but in the mind. The importance of design thinking is how user research informs development and design teams to become the voice of the user and create meaningful user experiences.

              <p>
                Reviewing the technological change of the past two generations of humans, it becomes clear that there's no sign of slowing down any time in the near future. Our eyes should be kept open to increasing automation (and decreasing employment), Moore's Law, Artificial Intelligence, and Singularity, as these topics have drastic human implications.

              <em>Vehicle based surveillance technology 101</em>
              <p>
                Vehicle based surveillance is utilized in many cities throughout the world. Very little is known by the general public about how to identify when vehicle based surveillance is being used and their methods. This information needs to be accessible and understandable by the technical and non-technical alike. As the general public becomes more savvy of information security, surveillance strategies will increasingly transition back to analog methods.
